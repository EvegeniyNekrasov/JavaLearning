## Point

You have to represent a point in 2D space. Write a class with the name Point. The class needs
two fields with name x and y of type int.

The class needs to have two constructors. The first constructor does not have aby parameters. The
second constructor has parameters x and y of type int and it needs to initialize the field.

##### Write the following methods (instance methods):
- Method named **getX** without any parameters, it needs to return the value of x field.
- Method named **getY** without any parameters, it needs to return the value of y field.
- Method named **setX** with one parameter of type int, it needs to set the value of the x field.
- Method named **setY** with one parameter of type int, it needs to set the value of the y field.
- Method named **distance** without any parameters, it needs to return the distance between this Point and Point 0,0 as double.
- Method named **distance** with two parameters x, y both of type int, it needs to return the distance between this Point and Point x,y as double.
- Method named **distance** with parameter another of type Point, it needs to return the distance between this Point and another Point as double.
