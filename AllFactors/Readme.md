#### All Factors

Write a method named **printFactors** with one parameter of type **int** named number.

**If number is < 1**, the method should **print "Invalid Value"**.

The method should print all factors of the number. A factor of a number is an integer which divides
the number wholly(i.e. without leaving a remainder).

For example, 3 is factor of 6 because 3 fully divides 6 without a remainder. In other words 6 / 3 = 2.

#### Example of INPUT / OUTPUT:
> **printFactors(6);** should **print 1 2 3 6**
> 
> **printFactors(32);** should **print 1 2 4 8 16 32**
> 
> **printFactors(10);** should **print 1 2 5 10**
> 
> **printFactors(-1);** should **print "Invalid Value"**
