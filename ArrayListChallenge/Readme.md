Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities
Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names

You will want to create a separate class fo Contacts (name abd phone number)
Create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts

The MobilePhone class has the functionality listed above

Add a menu of options that are available
Options: Quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing contact, remove contact
and search/find contact

When adding or updating be sure to check if the contact alrady exists (use name)
Be sure not to expose the inner working of the ArrayList to MobilePhone

e.g. no ints, no .get(i) etc

MobilePhone should do everythong with Contact objects only
